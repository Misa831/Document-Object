# hw6-Doc
Doc Project created in school. This project is utilized as practice of OOP by creating our own data structure. Specifically, Doc project takes in the contents of a text file, and adds them to our data structure represented as a "Document" with multiple implemented methods to edit the document. Utilizes a vector as primary container within the Doc object. 
This program was entirely programmed by me usign C++ 2017.
